Parameter Selection:

Target Variable (y): I chose topic as the target for classification. It represents the mental health category (e.g., Depression, Anxiety, Trauma), which is a distinct and meaningful label to predict.

Feature (X): I chose question as the input feature. Using Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF), we can analyze the text of the question to predict which topic it belongs to.

Model: A Logistic Regression model was used, which is effective for text classification tasks.
